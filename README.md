**ðŸš€ How the Game Works (Backend Flow)**


_User Creation_

The user enters a username (min length=8 and max length=20)
Backend stores the user in PostgreSQL.
Returns a user ID to track progress.

_Fetching a New Question_

The game requests a new question.
The backend selects respective clues from the database.
Sends a list of clues and 4 options.

_Answer Submission & Validation_

User selects an answer.
Backend validates the answer and updates the score.
Returns whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
If correct, a fun fact is included in the response.

_Fetching User Score_

The frontend requests the userâ€™s current score.
The backend fetches score data from the database.

_Hint System_

User can request a hint.
The backend returns a trivia hint for the current question.




**Endpoints**

POST /users/create_user
POST /game/question
POST /game/correct_answer
